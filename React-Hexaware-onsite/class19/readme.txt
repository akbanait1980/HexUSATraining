1. unit testing
2. integration testing
3. end to end testing


- unit testing?
unit testing means testing the smallest unit of the application
it plays a cruical role in the test-driven development
unit testing is all about testing method indivually and in the isolation


What - test the different building block -> the smallest building block that make your app

How

jest -> it is a tool for running out tests and asserting the result

React testing library - it is a tool for simulating (rending) our react app / component

both the tools are already setup for your app when we create new app using create-react-app

 "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.3",
    "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.4",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",

we can also add any other library jasmine, mocha, enzyme etc


Triple A - golden rule of unit testing
A  -Arrange
A - Act
A - Assert
